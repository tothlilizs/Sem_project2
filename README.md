# Noah's ark
This is our 2rd semester project created in spring of 2021 for the Software Engineering course at [VIA](https://via.dk/) university college, campus Horsens, DK. 
## Description
The project was created to establish a platform for canine enthusiasts where they can post, answer questions and advertise their services. The site also has a search to make it easier to browse through said services.

The requirements were to create a multi-user relational database management system in Java and the database in PostrgreSQL. The development must be Agile, the methodology must be Scrum and the system must be tested with JUnit.
